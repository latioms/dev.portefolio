## getting started

### prerequisites

- have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
- have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
- basic familiarity with your machine's command line
- basic understanding of JSON data outline (arrays of objects basically)

## how to use

- fork the repository and clone locally
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- once installation is complete, run `npm run start` to get your local copy running in the browser.

## template instructions

### 1. replace the images

- open the project in your file explorer, and navigate to `src/img`. there, you will see a bunch of images. these need
  to be replaced with your own images.

#### self.png

- add an image of yourself with the background removed, and cropped into a square. i know this seems picky, but the
  template is set up in a way that this is how it will look best :) I recommend using https://remove.bg to remove the
  background from your image. Once you add it to this img folder, rename it to `self.png` (delete the old self.png so
  yours replaces it)
- if background removal is not an option for you, any image you use will automatically be made into a circle. for this
  reason, square images without too tall of an aspect-ratio work best.
- example with background removed:

- example with background not removed:

#### mockups

- add to the `img` folder up to 5 screenshots of projects you have completed to be added to your portfolio page. this
  can either be a regular screenshot, or you can create mockups like what are on the default template. I created these
  in Canva
